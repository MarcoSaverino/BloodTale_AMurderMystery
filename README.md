# BloodTale_AMurderMystery
Welcome to the chilling tale of an investigator trying to save themselves from being hunted by solving the identity of the killer.
The point of the game is that a Serial killer is coming after you and you will have to find out who he is based on the clues he provides. Each day will present you with a new clue and a new puzzle then by the last day you are tasked with inputting the killers name into a prompt to survive or you die. Ill start off with a demo of the first day.
